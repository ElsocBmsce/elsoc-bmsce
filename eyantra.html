            <h3>e-Yantra Robotics Competition</h3>

            <hr />
            <p>
              The present landscape for the development of Higher Education
              systems in India has received many notable contributions to the
              field in the last decade or two. One of the most ubiquitous and
              noticeable sources of these contributions has been the rapid boom
              of technological advances, which has broadened the horizon for
              organizations whose primary focus is the growth of our education
              system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among the many reputable organizations in this field, is e-Yantra,
              a robotics outreach program that originated as an initiative of
              the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian
              Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT Bombay). Funded by the
              Ministry of Education, their objective is “to harness the talent
              of young engineers to to solve problems using technology across a
              variety of domains such as: agriculture, manufacturing, defense,
              home, smart-city maintenance and service industries”. They nurture
              young engineers with a practical outlook to help in providing
              pragmatic solutions to real world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their flagship initiative, has been the e-Yantra Robotics
              Competition (eYRC), a 2-stage contest that comprises abstracted
              gamified problem statements (called Themes) range from a variety
              of skills including ROS, Machine Learning, Image Processing, 3D
              Designing, Embedded Systems, Functional Programming, etc. The
              competition is open to students from an engineering or polytechnic
              background and is conducted completely online over a period of 5-6
              months, during the first stage, post which a selected set of
              participants from Stage 1 is selected into Stage 2. The leading
              5-6 teams are then hosted for the National Finals at IIT Bombay in
              March every year where they demonstrate their projects before a
              jury. The experience is hands-on and is meant to enhance and
              complement a participant’s engineering education. Prizes include a
              6 week paid internship at IIT Bombay and cash prizes worth
              10,00,000 INR.
            </p>
            <p>
              The amount of expertise gained through the competition is said to
              be unparalleled by any other technical competition all over India.
              Manu Saraogi, who recently completed his tenure as e-Yantra’s
              Campus Ambassador for B.M.S College of Engineering, commended
              Prof. Kavi Arya - the founder of e-Yantra - and his entire team at
              IIT Bombay for the influence they have had on his technical and
              non technical skills throughout the course of the competitions and
              the internship. e-Yantra continues to nurture young talent and has
              now expanded to countries abroad, in South East Asia and Africa.
              Their search for engineers who possess the potential to make a
              difference continues as they provide a platform to hone the skills
              of these bright minds every year through this competition,
              encouraging millions of students to try and make a difference.
