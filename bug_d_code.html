                <span style="color: orange">Question 1:</span> Given an array of
                integers, find the sum of its elements.<br />
                For example, if the array
                <i>ar = [1,2,3], then 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 </i><br />So the function

                will have one candle for each year of her total age.<br />
                When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out
                the tallest ones. Your task is to find out how many candles she
                can successfully blow out.<br /><i
                  >For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the
                  cake will have 4 candles of height 4,4,1,3, she will be able
                  to blow out 2 candles successfully, since the tallest candles
                  are of height 4 and there are 2 such candles.</i

                <span style="color: orange">Question 4: </span>You will be given
                two arrays of integers and asked to determine all integers that
                satisfy the following two conditions:<br />
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    The elements of the first array are all factors of the
                    integer being considered
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of
                    the second array
                  </li>
                </ol>
                These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays.
                You must determine how many such numbers exist. For example,
                given the arrays
                <i
                  >a = [2,6] and b = [24,36], there are two numbers between
                  them:</i
                ><br />6 and 12.<br />6 % 2 = 0 and 6 % 6 = 0, 24 % 6 = 0 and 36
                % 6 = 0 for the first value. <br />
                Similarly, 12 % 2 = 0, 12 % 6 = 0 and 24 % 12 = 0, 36 % 12 = 0.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
            <li>
              <span style="color: orange">Question 5: </span>A jail has a number
              of prisoners and a number of treats to pass out to them. Their
              jailer decides the fairest way to divide the treats is to seat the
              prisoners around a circular table in sequentially numbered chairs.
              A chair number will be drawn from a hat. Beginning with the
              prisoner in that chair, one candy will be handed to each prisoner
              sequentially around the table until all have been distributed.<br /><br />

              The jailer is playing a little joke, though. The last piece of
              candy looks like all the others, but it tastes awful. Determine
              the chair number occupied by the prisoner who will receive that
              candy.<br /><br />For example, there are 4 prisoners and 6 pieces
              of candy. The prisoners arrange themselves in seats numbered 1 to
              4. Let's suppose two is drawn from the hat. Prisoners receive
              candy at positions 2,3,4,1,2,3. The prisoner to be warned sits in
              chair number 3.
